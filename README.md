# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
Get the coordinates from user 
### Step 2:
Assign the coordinates to the variables 
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.jpg)
### Step 4: 
print the substituted distance formula
### Step 5: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:
```
Program to find the distance between two points.

import math as m
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
d=m.sqrt((l2[0]-l1[0])**2+(l2[1]-l1[1])**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
```


### OUTPUT:
!['output'](/Distancebetweentwopoints.png)


### RESULT:
Thus finding the distance between two points program executed successfully
